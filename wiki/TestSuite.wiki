#summary Portal for all tests to verify the running of ahmidas.

= Introduction =

Because of the unforeseeable diversity of systems that ahmidas may run on, it is important to begin devising a set of unit tests as early on in the development process as possible. Many core components should be rigorously tested and testable.

= Tests =

== Endianness ==

A program that:
  # should test and report on the endianness of the system ahmidas is running on (or going to run on in case of cross-compilation)
  # verifies proper conversion of little endian to big endian and vice versa
  # does the above for at least double and float, but perhaps more

== SU3 ==

=== Matrix ===

==== Reunitarization ====

A program that:
  # creates a random (full rank) matrix and then reunitarizes it and verifies that the result is indeed special unitary
  # creates a random SU3 matrix and verifies that it is unchanged under reunitarization

=== Vector ===

== MPI ==

== Grid ==

== Fields ==

=== Gauge ===

A program that:
  # Reads a complete gauge field (should be of reasonable size like 4^4)
  # Writes a complete gauge field

Perhaps it is useful to also test the entire reading, endianness swapping and float to double conversion/reunitarization chain here as well

==== APE smearing ====

=== Spinor ===
