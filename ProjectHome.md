**Ahmidas** aims to provide a tool for performing contractions of lattice propagators into physical correlators, using parallel computing since the memory footprint of contracting on top of current European Twisted Mass Collaboration simulations warrants such an approach. The interface is written in terms of lattice wide operators, which enables support for parallelism under the hood..
