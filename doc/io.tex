\section{Scidac Checksum}
The Scidac CRC32 checksum implemented in the code dynamically generates the CRC table based on the CRC polynomial $(0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 22, 23, 26)$. This CRC table has been checked against the tmLQCD implementation and gives identical results. For reference, the table generated is listed in the code.

The checksum itself comes in two parts, one with rank modulo $29$ and one with rank modulo $31$. These are named differently in our codes, so the following table is intended to give the proper correspondence:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 mathematical & xlf-info & array & accessor \\
\hline
 rank$\%29$ & \verb|<suma>| & \verb|[0]| & \verb|lower()| \\
 rank$\%31$ & \verb|<sumb>| & \verb|[1]| & \verb|upper()| \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
