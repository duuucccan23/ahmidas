#summary All the things we should at some point prior to release do, but don't want to clutter up the Issues list with.

= Introduction =

Use the standard GTD conventions here. No Someday/Maybe items on this list. Only actionable and well defined items.

  * Generate a 8^4^ test gauge configuration for use with all the unit tests. This file will be about 2.5 Mb in size. A 4^4^ test lattice will obviously be much smaller, but less suitable for MPI tests. Export a decent network connection anyway, so a 2.5Mb testfile should not be any problem

  * Generate test propagators corresponding to the test gauge configuration for use with unit tests.

  * Refactorize functions from some of the longer source files.

  * Define and implement a proper naming convention for the source files. See [NamingConventions].

  * Include proper licenses and comments on all files.

  * Decide about a documentation system (Doxygen?)
