#summary Ahmidas installation manual

= Introduction =

During development, all the small incremental steps needed to get Ahmidas running can be easily dismissed as trivial. For a fresh install, all the steps should be gathered. That is the purpose of this page.

= Installation =

  # Ahmidas is currently stored in an SVN repository. So the first requirement is a working SVN-client. Tarballs may be an option later. Checkout instructions are available on the project website under Source.
  # The build system is [http://www.cmake.org cmake}, which is usually available on systems or through systems such as apt.
  # Compilation goes via and MPI compiler such as mpic++. So {{{export CXX=mpic++}}} and then run {{{cmake $PATH_TO_SOURCE_DIRECTORY}}}.
  # Then {{{make all}}} to compile all the tests and all executables.
  # Preferably run {{{make test}}} or the more verbose {{ctest -V}}}.
